Welcome to "Ohm Simulator"!

"Ohm Simulator" is a powerful tool for program engineering teams working with electrical assemblies. It allows teams to simulate the measurement uncertainty of their equipment, and to visualize the results in a clear and concise way. This can help teams to make more informed decisions about how to properly guardband their tolerances, which will ultimately lead to more accurate and reliable electrical assemblies.

The software allows you to input your measurement uncertainty data from the calibration certificate and simulate the measurements under different temperatures and frequencies. The results are displayed in charts and graphs that can help the user to visualize the uncertainty and communicate it to other stakeholders. Additionally, "Ohm Simulator" also allows you to simulate the measurement uncertainty of the equipment under different temperatures and conditions, which will help to ensure that the tolerance of the electrical assemblies are properly guard banded.

Please note that "Ohm Simulator" is intended for use by program engineering teams with a basic understanding of metrology and measurement. It is not intended for use by untrained individuals.

How to use:

Download and install "Ohm Simulator" onto R Studio. 
Input your measurement uncertainty data from the calibration certificate
Simulate the measurements under different target ranges. 
Choose your lower and higher limits for analysis
Review the results displayed in the charts and graphs
Print the results for auditing and record keeping. 
Use the results to make informed decisions about how to properly guardband your tolerances
Thank you for using "Ohm Simulator"! We hope that you find it to be a valuable tool for your work with electrical assemblies. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact us.
